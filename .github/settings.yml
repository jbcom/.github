# Organization .github repository settings
# This is the base configuration for all jbcom repositories
# Other repositories extend this using: _extends: .github

# Note: This repository itself uses organization defaults
# No _extends needed (this IS the source of truth)

# Control repositories use organization defaults
# No language-specific linters required
